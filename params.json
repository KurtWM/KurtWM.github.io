{"name":"jQuery.scrollon","tagline":"A jQuery plugin for creating an endlessly scrolling image.","body":"### Endless Scrolling for an Image\r\nAn image within an element will endlessly scroll. The plugin starts by creating a clone of an image, which it places beside the image. Then a container is wrapped around the images to act as a window to view the images through. The images are animated by progressively decreasing the left margin of the original image until it has scrolled outside of the visible area of the container. The duplicated image goes along for the ride to create the illusion that the image is endless. Once the original image has completely scrolled outside of the visible bounds of the container its margin is reset to zero and the animation is repeated.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
